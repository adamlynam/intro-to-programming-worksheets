# Introduction to Programming Worksheets

The worksheets are designed to support learners that are new to writing code and programming concepts.

I created these worksheets when running a course to introduce adult learners to programming concepts to better understand some of the folks they work with regularly. The content is designed to be largely self directed, to be attempted at the learners own pace as they are able to focus on it over the course of a day or week. A teacher with an existing programming background should be able to support a number of learners working through the content simultaneously.
